# Project Log

Use this file to record meaningful project changes, implementation decisions, and verification notes.

## 2026-06-23 - Product report website redesign

- Reworked `website/index.html` and `website/styles.css` into a static product report for the Job Builder roadmap.
- Focused the page on current tracker capabilities, future dashboard metrics, Gmail and Grok response intelligence, and offer comparison planning.
- Kept the site informational only; no app code, email integration, API calls, compensation logic, or database behavior was implemented.
- Created the work on branch `codex/frontend-report-website`.

Verification:

- Checked for non-ASCII characters in changed static files.
- Reviewed the page in the browser at desktop and mobile widths.
- Confirmed no horizontal overflow and confirmed the next report section is visible in the first viewport.
